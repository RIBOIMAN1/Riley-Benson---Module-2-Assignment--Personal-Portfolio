            <b><center>About Me</center></b>
            <br>
            My name is Riley Benson. I am 17 years old, and I go to Lemoore College, formerly known as West Hills College Lemoore. Some hobbies that I have include learning more about computer hardware and software, playing video games, being competitive in Super Smash Bros. (I main [meaning the character you use most competitively] Sonic [üîµü¶î] but my soul main [another way to say your favorite character] is King K Rool [üëëüêä] cause he's epic), and tinkering with Linux, my favorite computer operating system. I also used to be a concert, jazz, and marching band member back in grade school, being a Trumpet player. My goals while in college are to set myself up for a path where I can become a computer programmer / software engineer, as not only does it make lots of money and has high demand, but I also love computers.<br>
            <br>
            I know quite a bit about computers. Some things I do include:<br>
                ‚Ä¢Using Linux as my main operating system (I use Arch Linux [Vanilla or Manjaro] and Ubuntu)<br>
                ‚Ä¢Working with a Linux terminal very frequently<br>
                ‚Ä¢Working with Minecraft commands (I know it sounds weird if you don't know about this, but Minecraft has a sort of "coding language" you can play around with called "commands"). This is where I started my coding skills.<br>
                ‚Ä¢Working on PC hardware<br>
                ‚Ä¢Being a "tech guy" for my friends and fixing their computers<br>
                ‚Ä¢Modding my own and my friend's gaming consoles<br>
                ‚Ä¢Knowing ways to get discontinued software for personal use via archive sites that without them otherwise don't exist anymore<br>
